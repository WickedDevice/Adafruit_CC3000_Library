# WildFire CC3000 Library

This is a library for the Wicked Device WildFire Development Board. 
It is derived directly from the Adafruit CC3000 Library found here:

https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CC3000_Library

Original Arduino library Written by Limor Fried & Kevin Townsend for Adafruit Industries.  
CC3000 host core written by TI

Place the WildFire_CC3000 library folder your *arduinosketchfolder*/libraries/ folder. 
You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.

NOTE: the 'SendTweet' example currently DOES NOT WORK due to Twitter API changes. The code is being kept for posterity in case a workaround can be developed.
